          <h2>Know the signs</h2>
          <p>
            The symptoms of infection for the new coronavirus are often similar
            to those of other respiratory virus infections, such as influenza.
            Symptoms can include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Most
            people will only have mild symptoms, but some can become very sick.
            When person-to-person spread has occurred with other novel
            coronaviruses that caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory
            Syndrome (MERS), it is thought to have happened mainly via
            respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or
            sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens
            spread. Spread of MERS and SARS has generally occurred between
            people in close contact.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you think you may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and
            have symptoms, before going to a doctor’s office or emergency room,
            call ahead and tell them about your symptoms and any recent travel.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor will
            determine whether or not you need to come in to be evaluated. Avoid
            contact with others and wear a face mask if you need to leave your
            home when you are sick.

          <h2>Keep things clean</h2>
          <p>
            Preventative measures are your first line of defense. The best way
            to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to practice good hygiene and to
            make these Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC)
            recommendations part of your routine
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The source of the coronavirus is believed to be a "wet market" in
            Wuhan which sold both dead and live animals including fish and
            birds.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Such markets pose a heightened risk of viruses jumping from animals
            to humans because hygiene standards are difficult to maintain if
            live animals are being kept and butchered on site. Typically, they
            are also densely packed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The animal source of the latest outbreak has not yet been
            identified, but the original host is thought to be bats. Bats were
            not sold at the Wuhan market but may have infected live chickens or
            other animals sold there.

          <h2>Maintain food Hygiene</h2>
          <p>
            The 2019 novel coronavirus causes respiratory illness, not foodborne
            illness — meaning it affects the lungs, not the digestive system.
            According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there’s
            currently no reason to believe that the virus has been spread via
            food or food packaging.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But officials still urge everyone to follow basic food safety
            guidelines that call for washing your hands before eating or
            preparing food, using clean utensils, and properly preparing and
            storing food. Restaurants and delivery services should also be
            following safe food preparation and handling practices.

          <h2>Cancel travel plans</h2>
          <p>
            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends avoiding
            all nonessential travel to mainland China, Iran, South Korea, and
            Italy. Older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should
            consider postponing nonessential travel to Japan. For people at risk
            for the complications of COVID-19, such as those with underlying
            medical conditions or those who are older, it may be prudent to
            avoid any long-distance travel,
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            he Foreign Office advised British nationals to avoid all
            non-essential foreign travel for at least 30 days. In any case,
            several countries have established travel bans, preventing Britons
            and foreign nationals from entering.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Keep in mind, layovers at airports in these destinations also count.
            If a layover is unavoidable, the CDC recommends that travelers not
            leave the airport. Travelers with layovers may still be subject to
            screening and monitoring when entering the Country.

          <h2>Do general cleaning</h2>
          <p>
            In everyday life, you can reduce your risk of infection by
            maintaining good hand hygiene.
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Start cleaning from cleaner areas and proceed towards dirtier
              areas. All surfaces that are frequently touched (e.g. door
              handles, armrests, table tops, light switches, water taps) need to
              be cleaned thoroughly and frequently.
            </li>
            <li>
              In public premises where people touch the surfaces, the cleaning
              should be done daily at least. If possible even more often e.g.
              between 2-4 hours especially during the epidemic.
            </li>
            <li>
              The public premises of workplaces must be cleaned using different
              equipment than the premises used by employees.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a mildly alkaline all-purpose detergent for cleaning. The
              cleaning of sanitary facilities can be enhanced by using a
              disinfectant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wear gloves to protect the hands when cleaning surfaces. After
              cleaning, the gloves must either be carefully washed and dried or
              replaced with a new pair.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use tight-fitting disposable gloves, for example, as all-purpose
              gloves. Long gloves must be used when cleaning toilets, and the
              gloves must then be kept separate from other cleaning equipment
              until they are carefully washed with water and detergent at the
              end of the cleaning round.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carefully clean the equipment used in cleaning at the end of the
              cleaning process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use leakproof and easily removable bags in waste bins. Monitor
              waste bins and do not let them get more than three-quarters
              full. Empty waste bins daily, especially in public premises. The
              collected bin bags must be closed tightly and disposed of in mixed
              waste for incineration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wash hands and forearms with water and soap when the gloves are
              taken off.
            </li>
