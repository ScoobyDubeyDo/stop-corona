          <h2>What treatments are available?</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19,
            and no vaccine is currently available. The treatment is symptomatic,
            and oxygen therapy represents the major treatment intervention for
            patients with severe infection. Mechanical ventilation may be
            necessary in cases of respiratory failure refractory to oxygen
            therapy, whereas hemodynamic support is essential for managing
            septic shock.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            On January 28, 2020, the WHO released a document summarizing WHO
            guidelines and scientific evidence derived from the treatment of
            previous epidemics from HCoVs. This document addresses measures for
            recognizing and sorting patients with severe acute respiratory
            disease; strategies for infection prevention and control; early
            supportive therapy and monitoring; a guideline for laboratory
            diagnosis; management of respiratory failure and ARDS; management of
            septic shock; prevention of complications; treatments; and
            considerations for pregnant patients.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Among these recommendations, we report the strategies for addressing
            respiratory failure, including protective mechanical ventilation and
            high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thereâ€™s currently no treatment specifically approved for COVID-19,
            and no cure for an infection, although treatments and vaccines are
            currently under study. Instead, treatment focuses on managing
            symptoms as the virus runs its course.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Seek immediate medical help if you think you have COVID-19. Your
            doctor will recommend treatment for any symptoms or complications
            that develop.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS are also treated by managing
            symptoms. In some cases, experimental treatments are tested to see
            how effective they are. Examples of therapies used for these
            illnesses include:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>antiviral or retroviral medications</li>
            <li>breathing support, such as mechanical ventilation</li>
            <li>steroids to reduce lung swelling</li>
            <li>blood plasma transfusions</li>
          </ul>
