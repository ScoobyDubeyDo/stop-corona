              It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never
              been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has
              transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation
              (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Coronaviruses are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause
              illness ranging from the common cold to severe respiratory
              diseases. Zoonotic means these viruses are able to be transmitted
              from animals to humans.There are several coronaviruses known to be
              circulating in different animal populations that have not yet
              infected humans. COVID-19 is the most recent to make the jump to
              human infection.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause disease in
              animals. Seven, including the new virus, have made the jump to
              humans, but most just cause cold-like symptoms.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Two other coronaviruses – Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers)
              and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – are much more
              severe, having killed more than 1,500 people between them since
              2002.

            <h2>How COVID-19 started?</h2>
            <p>
              In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases, caused by a newly
              identified β-coronavirus, occurred in Wuhan, China. This
              coronavirus, was initially named as the 2019-novel coronavirus
              (2019-nCoV) on 12 January 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO).
              WHO officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19) and Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International
              Committee proposed to name the new coronavirus as (SARS-CoV-2),
              both issued on 11 February 2020.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The source of the coronavirus is believed to be a "wet market" in
              Wuhan which sold both dead and live animals including fish and
              birds.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Such markets pose a heightened risk of viruses jumping from
              animals to humans because hygiene standards are difficult to
              maintain if live animals are being kept and butchered on site.
              Typically, they are also densely packed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The animal source of the latest outbreak has not yet been
              identified, but the original host is thought to be bats. Bats were
              not sold at the Wuhan market but may have infected live chickens
              or other animals sold there.

            <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
            <p>
              COVID-19 - spreads from person to person in close proximity,
              similar to other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu.Droplets
              of bodily fluids - such as saliva or mucus - from an infected
              person are dispersed in the air or on surfaces by coughing or
              sneezing.These droplets can come into direct contact with other
              people or can infect those who pick them up by touching infected
              surfaces and then their face.According to scientists, coughs and
              sneezes can travel several feet and stay suspended in the air for
              up to 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Transmission is of particular concern on transport, where droplets
              containing the coronavirus could pass between passengers or via
              surfaces like aeroplane seats and armrests. The incubation period
              of the coronavirus, the length of time before symptoms appear, is
              between one and 14 days. Although not yet confirmed, Chinese
              health authorities believe the virus can be transmitted before
              symptoms appear, China where wildlife was also traded illegally.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Close contact with an infectious person, such as shaking hands, or
              touching a doorknob, tabletop or other surfaces touched by an
              infectious person, and then touching your nose, eyes, or mouth can
              also transmit the virus.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Reports raised the possibility that the virus may be spread by
              fecal contamination of the environment, such as through leaky
              sewage pipes. Infections across multiple floors of a building due
              to contaminated bathroom pipes was previously demonstrated for
              SARS coronavirus.

            <h2>What are the Symptoms?</h2>
            <p>
              According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are
              fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a
              runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or
              diarrhoea. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild
              case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without
              needing any special treatment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ
              failure and even death.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, meaning they
              do not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their
              systems.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms whereas upper
              respiratory symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare,
              suggesting the differences in viral tropism as compared with
              SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV.

            <br />

              The elderly and those with underlying disorders (i.e.,
              hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes,
              cardiovascular disease), developed rapidly into acute respiratory
              distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis hard to
              correct and coagulation dysfunction, even leading to the death

            <h2>How deadly is it?</h2>
            <p>
              With more than 8,600 recorded deaths, the number of fatalities
              from this new coronavirus has surpassed the toll of the 2002-2003
              SARS outbreak, which also originated in China.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              SARS killed about 9 percent of those it infected - nearly 800
              people worldwide and more than 300 in China alone. MERS, which did
              not spread as widely, was more deadly, killing one-third of those
              infected.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              While the new coronavirus is more widespread than SARS in terms of
              case numbers, the mortality rate remains considerably lower at
              approximately 3.4 percent, according to the WHO.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This coronavirus is a new virus so we can only estimate the
              fatality rate of COVID-19 in these early stages.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Based on what we can see so far, COVID-19 is far less deadly to
              infected patients than Ebola or MERS. However, the fact that this
              coronavirus is so contagious and has crossed borders means
              significantly more people are expected to die.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For example, Ebola has killed about 11,300 people since its
              outbreak, a figure that COVID-19 has already surpassed. By
              contrast, we are preparing for 8,000 to 12,000 COVID-19 deaths
              this Summer alone.

              Yes, this outbreak is a global health emergency, the WHO said on
              January 30, raising the alarm further on March 11 when it declared
              the crisis a pandemic. The international health alert is a call to

            <h2>Are you immune to it?</h2>
            <p>
              Viruses that spread quickly usually come with lower mortality
              rates and vice versa. As the virus is an entirely new strain, it
              is believed that there is no existing immunity in anyone it will
              encounter. Some level of immunity will naturally develop over
              time, but this means that those with compromised immune systems,
              such as the elderly or sick, are most at risk of becoming severely
              ill or dying from the coronavirus.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Although the total number of deaths has now exceeded those
              recorded during the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS), the current mortality rate is much lower than
              that of SARS. The coronavirus mortality rate stands at 2.4
              percent, while SARS killed 9.6 percent of those infected.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If the virus keeps spreading, eventually so many people will have
              been infected and (if they survive) become immune that the
              outbreak will fizzle out on its own as the germ finds it harder
              and harder to find a susceptible host. This phenomenon is known as
              herd immunity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Vaccines create herd immunity too, either when given widely or
              sometimes when administered in a “ring” around a new case of a
              rare infection. That’s how diseases like smallpox were eradicated
              and why polio is close to being erased. Various vaccine efforts
              are under way for this coronavirus, but they may not be ready for
              more than a year.

              The coronavirus is new, so it doesn’t appear that anyone is immune
              to it: that’s what lets it spread and why it can have such severe
              effects in some people. For herd immunity to take hold, people
              must become resistant after they are infected. That occurs with
              many germs: people who are infected and recover become resistant
              to getting that disease again, because their immune system is
              charged with antibodies able to defeat it.

            <h2>What if I got recovered?</h2>
            <p>
              Even those who recover from COVID-19 might not be immune forever.
              Unfortunately, we don’t know yet whether or not the body’s immune
              response would protect you from subsequent infection
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It is known that exposure to the four seasonal human coronaviruses
              (that cause the common cold) does produce immunity to those
              particular viruses. In those cases, the immunity lasts longer than
              that of seasonal influenza, but is probably not permanent
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The majority of virologists are convinced that recovered COVID-19
              patients are immune to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus after the
              infection has run its course. After all, the body's own immune
              system has produced precisely those antibodies during the
              infection that render the pathogen harmless.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This all-clear also applies to those who had only a weak course of
              the disease and showed a few symptoms. Nevertheless, their immune
              systems reacted to the pathogen and produced the corresponding
              antibodies. A renewed infection with the new coronavirus is
              therefore highly unlikely.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              However,A small study of 12 patients discharged from hospital
              showed that two or three had reduced lung function and In some
              patients, lung function could decline by about 20 to 30% after
              recovery. Also the computer tomography have shown fluid- or
              debris-filled sacs in the lungs, which may get progressively worse
              as the illness develops. Nevertheless it is too early to confirm
              any long-term effects.

            <h2>What about other coronaviruses?</h2>
            <p>
              Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern
              respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that
              came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37
              countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people
              and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed
              from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of
              about 2,500 people who have been infected.
